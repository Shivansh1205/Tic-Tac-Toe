# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game, implemented in C! This classic game allows two players to compete in a friendly match of Tic Tac Toe, showcasing fundamental programming skills and game logic.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: C
- **Description**: A console-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game board is displayed in the terminal, and players alternate turns to place their marks.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Play against a friend locally.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use console interface for player interaction.
- **Game Logic**: Includes checking for wins, draws, and handling invalid moves.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Ensure You Have a C Compiler**

   Make sure you have a C compiler like `gcc` installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivansh1205/tic-tac-toe-c.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe-c
   ```

4. **Compile the Code**

   Compile the source code with:

   ```bash
   gcc -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.c
   ```

   This will create an executable file named `tic_tac_toe`.

5. **Run the Game**

   Execute the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Game Setup**

   - The game will prompt each player to enter their move.

2. **Player Moves**

   - Players take turns to enter the position where they want to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
   - The board is updated after each move.

3. **Winning the Game**

   - The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
   - The game ends when a player wins or all cells are filled.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **C Programming**: Utilizes core C programming concepts such as arrays, loops, and conditionals.
- **Game Logic**: Implements game rules and win condition checks.
- **Console-Based Interaction**: Creates a simple text-based user interface.
